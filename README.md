# Vehicle Tracking System for Embedded Systems Course

* I'm using Arduino IDE 2 (installed from Microsoft Store on Windows) and its workflow.
* The main file is `vehicle-tracking-sytem.ino`. Make sure the containing directory is named the same ("vehicle-tracking-system").
* You'll need `secrets.h` to be able to compile it (it contains the secret variables). Hit me up, and I'll send it to you.
* Here are the libraries you'll need to install in your Arduino IDE:
  * `ESPSupabase v0.1.0` by Jhagas Hana Winaya
  * `TinyGPSPlus v1.0.3` by Mikal Hart
  * (The dependencies of the above two will be installed automatically after it prompts you when you try to install them. If not, they are `ArduinoJson v7.4.1` by Benoit Blanchon, and `WebSockets v2.6.1` by Markus Sattler.)
